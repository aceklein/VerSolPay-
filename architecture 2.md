Architecture Overview

UNBNKD is a decentralized cross-chain banking platform with several key components:

1. Cross-Chain Payments
- Overview:Cross-chain payments are facilitated by smart contracts deployed on multiple blockchains (e.g., Solana, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain).
- How It Works:
  - A user sends a payment from Blockchain A.
  - The payment is routed through a cross-chain bridge (e.g., Wormhole) to Blockchain B.
  - On Blockchain B, the recipient receives the equivalent tokens.
  - All payments are secured with AI-driven fraud detection.

2. DEX Integration
- Overview:Decentralized Exchange (DEX) integration allows users to swap between tokens directly within the platform.
- How It Works:
  - Users interact with popular DEXes like Uniswap (Ethereum), Raydium (Solana), and PancakeSwap (BSC).
  - Smart contracts monitor liquidity pools and execute token swaps using AI optimization.

3. BNPL (Buy Now, Pay Later)
- Overview:BNPL allows users to make purchases and pay in installments.
- How It Works:
  - The platform uses smart contracts to track purchases and repayment schedules.
  - Payments can be completed in installments over time, with AI-based credit scoring determining user eligibility.
