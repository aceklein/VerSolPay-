Advanced Features of UNBNKD

1. AI-Based Fraud Detection
AI algorithms monitor transactions in real-time and flag suspicious activities. Smart contracts will halt transactions until reviewed.

2. Multi-Signature Wallets
Multi-signature wallets add an extra layer of security by requiring multiple approvals before executing any significant transaction.

To submit a transaction for approval:
solidity
submitTransaction(address to, uint amount);

#to approve this transaction

approveTransaction(uint txId);
