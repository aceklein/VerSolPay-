A refugee who has lost all physical identification applies for aid. The NGO issues an NFT Passport that is stored in the refugee’s digital wallet. This NFT Passport is interoperable with different platforms using **Polygon ID**, allowing the refugee to prove their identity when accessing services across multiple organizations. Simultaneously, the NFT Passport is linked to your payment platform for easy and secure verification during financial aid distribution, powered by **Solana ZK Compression** to maintain privacy.

 Innovation: **Offline Identity Verification for Decentralized NFT Passports**

 Innovation Concept:
This offline identity verification system allows users to authenticate and verify their NFT Passport identities without requiring constant internet access. This is especially critical in regions with limited connectivity, such as rural areas or refugee camps, as well as for businesses operating in locations with unreliable networks. The system leverages offline-compatible cryptographic tools, decentralized storage mechanisms, and temporary offline authentication to validate identities when internet access is unavailable. Once reconnected, the system can sync data back to the blockchain to ensure no integrity is lost.

The offline verification process will be tied to the NFT Passport system described previously, enabling businesses, institutions, individuals, and refugees to prove their identity in real-time, even without internet, and can later sync this data for further verification on-chain.
